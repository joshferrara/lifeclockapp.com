The launch of Life Clock! This version includes... the whole app. Before this update, the app didn't exist. You could say this is our biggest update so far.

#### What's Included?

	- This will be helpful as the app becomes available on other platforms. Looking at you MacOS.
- Life clock creation & editing

	- This one is great for screenshots to share on social.
- Editing life expectancy
